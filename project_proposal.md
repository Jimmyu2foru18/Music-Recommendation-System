# Music Recommendation System Project Proposal

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a sophisticated music recommendation system using Julia programming language. The system will leverage machine learning techniques to provide personalized song recommendations based on user listening history and song characteristics.

## Objectives
1. Create an efficient and scalable recommendation engine
2. Implement both collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation approaches
3. Develop meaningful visualizations for data analysis and results
4. Achieve high accuracy in song recommendations

## Technical Stack
- **Programming Language**: Julia
- **Key Libraries**:
  - Flux.jl for deep learning
  - MLJ.jl for machine learning
  - Plots.jl for visualization
  - DataFrames.jl for data manipulation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Preparation
- Acquire music dataset from public sources (Kaggle/Million Song Dataset)
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Create user-song interaction matrices

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering
- Extract relevant musical features
- Create user profiles
- Develop song similarity metrics

### Phase 3: Model Development
1. Collaborative Filtering Implementation
   - User-based collaborative filtering
   - Item-based collaborative filtering
   - Matrix factorization techniques

2. Content-based Filtering
   - Song feature analysis
   - User preference modeling
   - Similarity calculations

### Phase 4: Evaluation and Optimization
- Implement evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAP, etc.)
- Perform cross-validation
- Optimize model parameters

### Phase 5: Visualization and Analysis
- Create interactive visualizations
- Generate user preference insights
- Visualize recommendation patterns

## Expected Outcomes
1. A functional music recommendation system
2. Comprehensive performance analysis
3. Insightful visualizations
4. Documentation and usage guidelines

## Timeline
- Week 1-2: Data collection and preparation
- Week 3-4: Model development
- Week 5: Testing and optimization
- Week 6: Visualization and documentation

## Success Metrics
- Recommendation accuracy > 80%
- System response time < 2 seconds
- User satisfaction score > 4/5

## Future Enhancements
1. Real-time recommendation updates
2. Integration with streaming platforms
3. Advanced feature extraction
4. Scalability improvements
